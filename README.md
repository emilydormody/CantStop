# Can't Stop

Created during a group project for a Software Engineering course and was completed in April of 2023. Due to this being worked on as a group, I have not made the source code public, but a .jar file is available of the completed project. 

The contributions to this project were divided among the group members, but notably my contributions went towards the game's visual aspects/board layout, and towards the general game logic in determining what moves could and couldn't be made.
